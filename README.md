# SoldierPea

SoldierPea is a school project with the purpose of making the AI of an RTS game in Unity 2020.3.
For this we were to use a template given to use, improve and implement new functionnality on.

## Authors

It was made by:

- Am√©lie Pichard, who implemented the Behaviour Tree (Decision)
- Tristan Francillonne, who implemented the Tactician (Planification)
- Quentin Bleuse, who implemented the squad movement (Flocking)

## Techs

The project was developped under Unity 2020.3.33f1. Any version of Unity.2020.3 should be able to run the project.

We used a template provided by us that included:
 - player control
 - basic gameflow
 - basic UI

## How to run
We have no build so you can play on the viewport of Unity.

## How to play

Left Click - On your base (blue building) to create units 
A - To select all your units
Right Click - On the map to move your selected units
ZQSD or wheel Click - To move the camera

## Additional Notes

- there is still some bug in the planning AI, such as squads stopping.
- some things, such as Make Unit Task, are hardcoded due to the static number of units that we have and the lack of time to do something more modular.
